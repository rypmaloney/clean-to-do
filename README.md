# Clean To-do List

This is project is a to-do list web app with a clean interface. You create and organize to-do items by creating projects. You begin with three default projects: All, Today, and This Week. These projects are automatically populated with the to-dos you place in your own projects based on the due dates you assign each item.

#### A few features: 
- Checked items will automatically drop to the bottom of each list
- You can edit list items at any time by clicking on the text of the item.
- Sort by priority or due date

I'm most proud of the list item editing functionality. I was trying to emulate the Google notes app. Instead of opening a form to reenter the list information, you click on the item itself, and the form input is styled to leave the impression you are editing the item directly.
